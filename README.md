### Finding Items
- Currently the new item `Wrought nail` will be spawned while searching various locations, e.g. Workbench, Locker.
- I have also added spawns for all items in some locations. Those are guaranteed. e.g. QuonsetGasStation, CampOffice.
-->

### Adding Items
For those who don't want to spend time crafting, there is an instant way to get the item.<br>
Using the [DeveloperConsole](https://github.com/FINDarkside/TLD-Developer-Console) Items can be manually added to your inventory with the command `add <GearName>`.
(e.g. `add stickpile010`)<br>
The item is fully integrated into the console and will appear in the auto-complete when pressing tab.<br>
